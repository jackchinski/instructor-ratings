# How Beauty Trumps Performance: AnExamination of Instructor Evaluations at the University of Texas
## Overview
  This paper examines the impact of instructor beauty on course evaluations at the University of Texas between 2000 and 2002, while also considering other factors that may influence ratings. The findings suggest that beauty does have a positive effect on evaluations, as such the use of the instructor evaluations for the use of hiring, firing, and promoting instructors remains controversial.
